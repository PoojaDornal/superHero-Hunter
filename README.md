<li>This is repository of Superhero-Hunter using Vanilla Javascript, HTML and CSS </li>

# Problem statement - 
Create a superhero hunter app. Use ONLY vanilla javascript, no libraries or frameworks are allowed for Javascript (you can use any CSS framework like Bootstrap).

# Features Required -
- <b>Home Page</b>

- Fetch and display a list of SuperHeros (Characters) on the home page. Also create a search bar that will filter out the character based on search query. Suppose I type “bat” in the search box, it should show “batman”. 
[ API example https://gateway.marvel.com:443/v1/public/characters?ts=<time-stamp>&apikey=<public-key>&hash=<md5(ts+privateKey+publicKey)>]
- Each search result of the superhero should have a favorite button, clicking on which superhero should be added to “My favorite superheroes” (a list).
- On clicking any particular search result (any superhero), open a new page with more information about that superhero (Superhero page).

<b>Superhero Page</b>
- Should show a lot of information about the superhero like their name, photo, bio and other information provided by the API (comics, events, series, stories, etc).

<b>My favourite superheroes Page </b>
- Display a list of all the favourite superheroes.
- Make this list persistent (should have the same number of superheroes before and after closing the browser).
- Remove from favourites button: Each superhero should have remove from favourites button, clicking on which should remove that superhero from the list.
